# IntelliCode for Visual Studio Code FAQ

You can [download an experimental extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2006060) for Visual Studio Code. This article has answers to some frequently asked questions about the extension.

## Q. What functionality does the extension provide?

The IntelliCode extension for Visual Studio Code provides artificial intelligence-assisted IntelliSense for Python, Java, TypeScript, and JavaScript. AI-assisted IntelliSense predicts the most likely correct API for the developer to use, rather than just presenting an alphabetical list of members. It uses the developer's current code context and patterns to provide this dynamic list.

## Q. Will any other features be added to this extension?

We'll update the Visual Studio Code extension with more capabilities in the coming months.

## Q. I'm having trouble getting IntelliCode to download models behind my firewall - what should I do?

When using IntelliCode, you may see the error message "Couldn't download IntelliCode model. Please check your network connectivity or firewall settings.", or see similar messages in the IntelliCode output window pane in Visual Studio Code. IntelliCode starred suggestions may well not show up either. Problems with correct handling of proxies behind firewalls can cause this sort of issue.

As a first step, try updating to Visual Studio Code 1.30 or later, and [turning on network proxy support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_30#_network-proxy-support-for-extensions) .

If turning on network proxy support doesn't work for you, check the corresponding [github issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/intellicode/issues/4) and let us know more.

## Q. I'm having problems with Python IntelliSense in Visual Studio Code. Can you help?

For more information and tips, see the [Python language server troubleshooting](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/2177) page.

## Q. Which version of Visual Studio Code do I need to run the Visual Studio Code IntelliCode extension?

Youâ€™ll need Visual Studio Code October 2018 Release 1.29 or later to use this extension.

## Q. Which version of Java do I need to get AI-assisted IntelliSense for Java?

You'll need Java 8 Update 151 or higher.

If you try previous Java 8 versions, you'll see the error "java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size", and IntelliCode AI-assisted IntelliSense recommendations won't work.

## Q: What about privacy? Are you sending my code to the cloud? What customer data is being sent to Microsoft?

Refer to our [general FAQ on privacy](faq.md#-q-what-about-privacy-are-you-sending-my-code-to-the-cloud-what-customer-data-is-being-sent-to-microsoft) for information.
