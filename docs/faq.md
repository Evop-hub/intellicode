# Visual Studio IntelliCode FAQ

IntelliCode extensions are available for [Visual Studio](intellicode-visual-studio.md), and [Visual Studio Code](intellicode-visual-studio-code.md).

This FAQ answers some of the questions you may have.

## Q. What is Visual Studio IntelliCode?

Microsoft announced Visual Studio IntelliCode, a new capability that enhances software development using AI, at Build 2018. IntelliCode helps developers and teams code with confidence, find issues faster, and focus code reviews.

An early view of IntelliCode showed how it enhances the software development process in the following ways:

- Delivers context-aware code completions
- Guides developers to adhere to the patterns and styles of their team
- Finds difficult-to-catch code issues
- Focuses code reviews by drawing attention to areas that really matter

Developers can find more information and sign up for news and future private previews at [https://aka.ms/intellicode](https://aka.ms/intellicode).

## Q. What does Visual Studio IntelliCode enable customers to do?

Visual Studio IntelliCode is a range of capabilities that offers new productivity enhancements through artificial intelligence (AI). IntelliCode extensions are available for both [Visual Studio](intellicode-visual-studio.md) and [Visual Studio Code](intellicode-visual-studio-code.md). In both products, IntelliCode provides AI-assisted IntelliSense. The IntelliCode suggestions appear at the top of the completion list with a star icon next to them:

Additionally, the IntelliCode extension for Visual Studio offers further functionality for C# developers, including autogenerated EditorConfig files and customized IntelliSense based on your code. For more information, see [IntelliCode extension for Visual Studio](intellicode-visual-studio.md) or [IntelliCode extension for Visual Studio Code](intellicode-visual-studio-code.md).

## Q. Are there other features coming to the Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code IntelliCode extensions?

We're actively working on a number of capabilities that we're excited to share publicly as they become available. You can sign up for news and updates at [https://aka.ms/intellicode](https://aka.ms/intellicode) to be the first to know when we have new capabilities available.

## Q: What makes “AI-assisted IntelliSense” powered by IntelliCode better than regular IntelliSense?

With IntelliCode, the completion list suggests the most likely correct API for a developer to use rather than presenting a simple alphabetical list of members. To provide this dynamic list, IntelliCode uses the developer's current code context and patterns based on thousands of highly rated, open-source projects on GitHub. The results form a model that predicts the most likely and most relevant API calls.

For C# developers, IntelliCode can learn patterns from your code. This means IntelliCode can make recommendations on code that isn’t in the open-source domain, for example, methods in your own utility classes or domain-specific library calls. For more information, see [IntelliCode models based on your code FAQ](custom-models.md).

> [!NOTE]
> For models trained on open-source projects, IntelliCode doesn't collect any user-defined code. For models that learn patterns from your code, IntelliCode only collects the minimum data required to create the model. We keep the trained models secured, and only you and those you choose to share them with can access them. Your model and what it’s learned about your code stays private to you. For more information, see [Data and privacy](custom-models.md#data-and-privacy) and the question about [privacy](#privacy).

## Q: How good are the IntelliCode completion suggestions?

We’ve been using IntelliCode’s recommendations internally at Microsoft for some time, and believe the suggestions are useful. Ultimately, though, the proof will be in how useful these recommendations are to you as you code.

If you're a Visual Studio user developing in C#, C++, or XAML, try the [Visual Studio IntelliCode extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872707). If you use Python, Java, TypeScript, or JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, try the [Visual Studio Code IntelliCode extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2006060) a try. Let us know how the recommendations work out for you and send us your feedback. We’ll also train our model based on what you pick in our recommendations, and we'll update the extension as the model improves.

## Q. What's the future of IntelliCode?

We're exploring a wide range of ways to improve developer productivity using AI and other advanced techniques. At Microsoft Build 2018, we showed an early view of some of the scenarios where we think AI could assist developers. We’ve added more capabilities since then, but there are many more to go! We're interested in learning from developers that experiment with what we've shown, so sign up for news and updates at [https://aka.ms/intellicode](https://aka.ms/intellicode).

## Q. How much does it cost?

IntelliCode will always have a substantive free tier. During the preview, IntelliCode is free while we evaluate capabilities. Some of the features may no longer be free after the preview period is complete.

## Q. When will IntelliCode be released?

IntelliCode's AI-assisted IntelliSense is currently in experimental preview. We'll continue to update the experimental extension and accompanying service, and we'll add further capabilities in the future. We have no schedule for a final release, but we welcome feedback from developers so we can deliver the best possible experiences. You can sign up for news and updates at [https://aka.ms/intellicode](https://aka.ms/intellicode).

## Q. Which languages and tools are supported by this extension?

C#, C++, and XAML are supported for Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8 and later.

Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python are supported by the IntelliCode extension for Visual Studio Code.

Get the extension for your preferred tool from [https://aka.ms/intellicode](https://aka.ms/intellicode).

IntelliCode will likely be expanded to more languages and tools in the Visual Studio family in the future.

## Q. Why isn’t my favorite library seeing recommendations?

For all languages, we are continuously working to improve its base model's coverage of common libraries and types. We’d love to hear from you if there’s a common library we're missing&mdash;see [where should I raise bugs](#q-where-should-i-raise-bugs-issues-or-feature-requests).

For C# users, IntelliCode can now learn patterns from your own code. For more information, see [AI-assisted IntelliSense recommendations based on your code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.VSIntelliCode).

## Q. Where should I raise bugs, issues, or feature requests?

We are keen to hear from you as you try out IntelliCode. Tell us about any problems you encounter or features that you wish were available.

- **Visual Studio Code bugs:** [Log a new issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/intellicode/issues/new). Include any **Output** window log entries from VS IntelliCode and Python with the bug. You can also browse [existing issues](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/intellicode/issues) and up-vote them using a 👍 reaction.

- **Visual Studio bugs:** Use the [Help > Send Feedback > Report a Problem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio-2017) menu. If you reproduce the problem before submitting the report, logs will be automatically included in the report.

- **Feature requests:** For both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, [log a new issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/intellicode/issues/new) and mention that it's a feature request.

## Q. Is this experience only available in English?

IntelliCode is a preview extension today, and we're eager to understand how useful these capabilities are for a broad set of customers. When we take IntelliCode out of preview, we'll look at support for other languages.

## <a name="privacy"/> Q: What about privacy? Are you sending my code to the cloud? What customer data is being sent to Microsoft?

Developers are invited to experience Visual Studio IntelliCode today as an experimental preview extension. The purpose of the extension is to enable developers to test IntelliCode's capabilities and to provide feedback to the product team.

We capture some anonymized usage and error-reporting data from the extension to help improve the product. No user-defined code is sent to Microsoft, but we collect information about your use of the IntelliCode results.

For base model suggestions, which are open-source or .NET types and members, we capture whether you selected an IntelliCode suggestion and log the name of the suggestion in order to monitor and improve the base model.

For custom models, we only capture whether you selected an IntelliCode suggestion and do not log your user-defined types or methods.

In Visual Studio, developers can opt out of the [Visual Studio Experience Improvement Program](/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-experience-improvement-program), which turns off data collection for the IntelliCode extension too. From the menu bar, select **Help** > **Send Feedback** > **Settings**. In the **Visual Studio Experience Improvement Program** dialog, select **No, I would not like to participate** and then select **OK**.

In Visual Studio Code, developers can turn off sending usage data to Microsoft by following [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).

The IntelliCode extension may periodically ask the developer to complete a survey, which again is anonymized. Users can sign up for news and a future private preview, but are not currently required to do so to use the experimental extension.

If you use the new capability to create models that learn patterns from your own C# code, you need to [sign in to Visual Studio](/visualstudio/ide/signing-in-to-visual-studio) to be able to use the preview model training service. The training service collects only the minimum data that's required to create the model. Microsoft keeps the trained models secured to your account so only you and those you choose to share them with can access them. Your model and what it’s learned about your code stays private to you. For more information, see [Data and privacy](custom-models.md#data-and-privacy).

## Q. Are you planning to release Visual Studio IntelliCode as Open Source Software?

We have been gathering feedback from the community and making updates since we launched IntelliCode at Build 2018. We may make portions of the experimental IntelliCode extension open source in the future, but we have no announcements to make at this time.
