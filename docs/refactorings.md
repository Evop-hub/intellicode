# IntelliCode refactorings (Preview)

IntelliCode refactorings improves your editing experience when you're making similar edits in many places in your code. It locally tracks your edits, detects when you are performing a repetitive action, and offers to apply that same action in other places you may need to do so.  For instance, if you are making a refactoring, and have missed locations where it could be applied, IntelliCode will help you find those locations and fix them.

Opportunities to apply refactorings show up as a [lightbulb](/visualstudio/ide/quick-actions) in the editor, along with green [warning-level squiggles](/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/visual-studio-ide#popular-productivity-features), and warnings in the [error list](/visualstudio/ide/reference/error-list-window). The [code cleanup indicator](/visualstudio/ide/find-and-fix-code-errors?#run-code-cleanup) will also show any opportunities found in the current file. Clicking on the lightbulb displays a menu from which you can apply the change to the detected location.

Refactorings is aware of the semantic structure of your code. One advantage is it will detect cases where the variable names in your changes are different but the essential structure of the change is the same:

If you don’t like a suggested change, you can select the ignore option on the lightbulb and we won’t bother you about that pattern again unless you recreate it. 

## Enabling IntelliCode refactorings
Refactorings is a preview feature, so it is turned off by default. 
Go to the Tools-Options page, IntelliCode General tab, Preview features area, and switch C# refactorings to “Enabled” to turn it on:

Once you change this setting, close any files you may have open, then restart Visual Studio.
